## Contributing to CliFM

* The best way to contribute is taking a look at the currently open [issues](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/issues) and provide some help, or creating a new one pointing out bugs (make sure to provide enough information to make the bug reproducible) and suggesting missing or wanted features (I'm running out of ideas). I'll do my best to fix whatever is broken and to add/improve whatever is missing. Always bear in mind the [bugs](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) and [feature request](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md) templates, and, in case of sending us some code or patch via a pull request, the [coding guidelines](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/blob/master/src/README.md).
* For the time being, it includes only a spanish translation (which is now out dated, by the way). New translations are a nice way to contribute (you can find the .pot file in the `translations` directory).
* Test it on other operating systems (working fine now on Linux and FreeBSD) and other architectures (successfully tested on i386, x86_64, and ARM).
* Of course, you can also tell your friends about CliFM, write a (positive) review of it somewhere on the internet, or you can just create a nice logo and print it on a t-shirt to tell the world how great ClifM is (just kidding, or not). Seriously, we are still looking for a decent logo ([#17](https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/issues/17)).
* Buy me a beer.
